This repository contains both (1) modified code from msABC (Pavlidis et. al., 2010) and (2) custom code from the barn swallow two subspecies ABC analysis.

Regarding the modified msABC code. The (mostly) original version of the ms.c file is also uploaded here, because to our knowledge the download website, http://bio.lmu.de/~pavlidis/msabc, is no longer functional. The modified version is described in our supplementary information. Of note, the "resample" method no longer resamples event times, but resamples population sizes to ensure that populations grow or shrink by at least 2x. This is accomplished by specifying the absolute parameter numbers of the popualtion sizes (not the population size number.)
